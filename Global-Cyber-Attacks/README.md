Power BI project visualizing the scale of cyber threats worldwide - Really interesting for the Insurance industry! 

After getting the dataset from a friend, and having worked in the insurance industry for 5 years I wanted to show the critical impact of cyber attacks and how are becoming more frequent, smarter and more expensive to recover from. There is no doubt companies need cyber insurance!

This project turns messy threat data into a clear story of who is being targeted, how often, and with what methods.  

### 🕵️‍♂️ Focus areas
- Attack frequency by region and sector  
- Timeline of major global incidents  
- Correlations with political or economic events  
- Emerging patterns in ransomware & phishing attacks  

### 🧠 Tools & stack
Power BI | DAX | M Language

### 📊 Data source
Public dataset included in the folder.



PBI report can be shared privately upon request to see all the work I have done. I didn't want to publicly share it here to prevent the copy and reouse without permission.
