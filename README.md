# Smart Analytics 2025 by Manuel La Chica

Hola/Welcome!

In this repo you will find a collection of analytical challenges I’ve taken on lately - the kind that make you think “someone should probably look into that”... so I did.

Two projects where I explore topics that define today’s world — from global energy trends to cyber attack patterns. 
Each project aims to:

-Turn complex data into clear insights

-Combine storytelling with technical depth 

-Showcase practical applications of modern data tools (Python, SQL and Power BI)


If you enjoy analytics and curious like me, you’ll feel like home here.
