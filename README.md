# Smart Analytics 2025 by Manuel La Chica

Welcome!

In this repo you will find a collection of analytical challenges I’ve taken on lately - the kind that make you think “someone should probably look into that”... so I did.

Two projects where I explore topics that define today’s world — from global energy trends to cyber attack patterns. 🧨 — through the lens of data, logic, and curiosity.

Each project aims to:

Turn complex data into clear insights 📈

Combine storytelling with technical depth 🧩

Showcase practical applications of modern data tools (Python, SQL and Power BI) 🛠️


If you enjoy smart analytics and curiosity, you’ll feel right at home here.
